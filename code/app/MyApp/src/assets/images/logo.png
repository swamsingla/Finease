The file /taxfile-pro-mobile/taxfile-pro-mobile/src/assets/images/logo.png is intended to be an image file. Since I cannot generate binary image data directly, please ensure that you have the logo image you want to use and place it in the specified directory. 

If you need to create a placeholder or a blank image, you can use an image editing tool to create a simple logo and save it as `logo.png`, or you can download an existing logo and place it in that directory. 

This file is intentionally left blank.
