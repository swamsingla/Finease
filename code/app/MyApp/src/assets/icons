The directory for icons is typically used to store icon images. Since you haven't specified any particular icons to include, I will create a placeholder file to indicate that this directory is intentionally left blank.

Here are the contents for the file: /taxfile-pro-mobile/taxfile-pro-mobile/src/assets/icons:

// This directory is intentionally left blank for icon images used in the application.
